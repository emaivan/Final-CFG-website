        <p class="boxShadow">We are CÉLIA, a company obsessed with minimalism. We are here to prove that having less does not mean feeling less. By deconstructing the “rules” that surround minimalism, we provide interior design services to show that minimal design has various meanings and can span different interior styles itself. From modern to retro to Victorian, there is no challenge that we cannot tackle.<br><br>
        <strong>To be honest</strong>, this is not yet a real company. This website has been created by a beginner coder who's intimidated by Javascript. Because of this, this website was created using HTML and CSS only. Attempts were made to make this website as accessible and responsive as possible. Nonetheless, the recommended screen width for viewing is of 1440 pixels and below. Those with giant monitors are not welcome here. Sorry not sorry.<br><br>

        <p class="boxShadow-2">We are professional interior designers specialising in minimalist designs. We help those wanting to embrace the future to find peace, cosiness and creativity in simplicity. Minimalist interior design does not have to be bland, but, with the right colors and furniture pieces, it can transform the home to reflect the uniqueness of its owners themselves. A cluttered home does not equal a better home and we are here to prove it.<br><br>
          Our specialists have spent numerous years studying the psychology of interior designing and have transferred their skills to provide the best service possible to our clients. Thus, as a company, we thrive on close communication with our clients and provide them with the opportunity to be part of every single step of the creative process. After all, it is you your home needs to reflect.<br><br>
          We also make custom furniture for those wanting to make a statement. Each piece is carefully hand-crafted from recycled and reclaimed materials. It is our priority to leave as small an ecological footprint as possible. Not to worry, your furniture will be of top quality.<br><br>
