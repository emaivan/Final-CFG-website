          <p tabindex="0" class="small-text"><strong>CÉLIA is not yet a real company.</strong></p>
          <p tabindex="0" class="smaller-text">The website you are seeing was created by <strong>Ema Ivanauskaite</strong>. She is a passionate beginner coder determined to become a software engineer and make her mark in the tech world. She has graduated from Birkbeck, University of London and holds a Bachelor degree in Law. Having had a love for tech for years and finally having acquired the confidence to code, she attended a beginners coding course organised by <strong>Code First: Girls</strong>. This website is the product of 8 weeks of learning and numerous hours of intense work. Ema also likes plants and has over 20 in her bedroom alone. Weird...</p>
          <p tabindex="0" class="smaller-text">Regarding CÉLIA, the idea for such a company was inspired by a documentary called <strong>"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things"</strong>. At some point during the documentary there is a scene in which we are shwon an almost empty room. It looked so boring and bland and made Ema question why anyone would want to live in such a place. And while there are plenty of those who pay little care to the personalities of their homes, Ema does and it's certain she is not alone. Individuals spend hours decorating their homes in the hopes of creating a space they want to be in and one that reflects who they are. That is exactly why a company like CÉLIA is needed. Minimalism does not have to equal emptiness and blandness. By using statement furniture and decor pieces, one can achieve the same feeling a crowded room would. Professional interior designers would be able to transfer the quirks of their clients to those clients' homes by close communication and by giving their clients the opportunity to be part of every step of the creative process, down to the name of their projects as well. Awesome (please someone adopt this idea).</p>
          <p tabindex="0" class="smaller-text"> If one dares to look at the code for the website, what will most certainly jump out is Ema's attempt to make the wesbite more accessible. Many of us take it for granted that we can see or use a mouse to scroll, to hover, to click and often pay little attention to how useable the website may be to other individuals. Well, Ema cares. Because of her newly-acquired knowldege in coding, it was her goal for this website to be as accessible as she could make it with. For those using screen readers and those keyboard users out there, Ema hopes you can navigate through this website just fine. She really did try her best.</p>
          <p tabindex="0" class="smaller-text"> As regards the responsiveness of the website, this one is down to pure luck. Fingers crossed.</p>
